I've duplicated the Skeleton files for each person - your file has your corresponding name indicated.
You can edit on your own skeleton file freely as you wish since it is completely separate from the other people's skeleton files :)
Do remember to make the necessary changes within the code. I've only added your names to the filename.

Hi all, Chunmun will be chopping his head to come up with some testing code. Purpose of which is to run each algorithm against each other and produce some sort of statistics for comparison. Should be done by the weekend if he's still alive.

Hi, testing from HQ.
